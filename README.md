⚠️ HEADS UP BEFORE DOWNLOADING ⚠️

this will *ONLY* work with FLStudio AND
I *HIGHLY SUGGEST* making *your own* 909s with Xfer Serum

# HOW DOES IT WORK?
Here are some gifs to help better explain how this plugin works

-

**1. THE ASYMMETRY SLIDER**

All this does is make your kick sound a little punchier.

**2. THE PUNCH/MAIN FREQUENCY**

This allows you to choose what frequency your kick and punch is in, just don't go too high

**3. THE SUB-BASS**

It's pretty self-explanatory, adds or removes sub (there will be a way to change the sub frequency in a future update)

**4. OUR BELOVED DISTORTION**

The main sauce of your kick. I would like to add that adding too much of this can SOMETIMES ruin the sound of your kick, don't add too much distortion

# HOW DO I GET A CLEANER SOUND?

I **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** that you guys do this so your kick isn't muddy.

All I'm doing here is removing the frequencies where I normally hear mud in my kick.

⚠️ HEADS UP ⚠️

**YOU DO NOT NEED PRO Q3 WHILE CLEANING UP, THIS IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE**

**MAKE SURE TO ADD A SOFT CLIPPER ON SLOT 9 OF YOUR MASTER CHANNEL AND EDISON ON SLOT 10 TO RECORD AUDIO**

**IN YOUR KICK CHANNEL PUT A SOFT CLIPPER ON SLOT 10**

**THIS WILL PREVENT YOUR KICK FROM BEING TOO LOUD AND HARD TO LISTEN TO**

⚠️ **ALL SOFT CLIPPERS SHOULD BE AT THEIR DEFAULT VALUE** ⚠️
